              circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-8">
              <li>
                The customer can replace the product unit received within 7 days
                from the date of delivery and get a replacement unit delivered
                to the customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
                product delivered in defective condition or has a physical
                damage within 24 hours of receipt of the product
              </li>

                the site or as per the specifications, you must bring it to the
                notice of our website support team within 24 hours of receiving
